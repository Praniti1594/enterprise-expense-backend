## Frontend (Demo Only)

This project includes a minimal HTML + JavaScript frontend used only to
demonstrate end-to-end API workflows (authentication, role-based access,
expense submission, approvals, and analytics).

The frontend is intentionally lightweight and not production-ready.
It is not deployed. The primary focus of this project is backend
architecture, business logic, and APIs.
